=head1 NAME

DataFlow::Proc::DBF - A dBase DBF converting processor


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DataFlow;

    # creating our flow
    my $flow = DataFlow->new([
       [ 'DBF' => { direction => 'CONVERT_FROM' } ],
    ]);


    # getting back a perl arrayref
    my $perl_struct = $flow->process( $slurped_dbf_data );


  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a processing step for dBase (DBF) files under
L<DataFlow>. It lets you C<CONVERT_FROM> a DBF file into a Perl
data structure (in this case, an array reference) and C<CONVERT_TO>
a DBF stream, from a Perl array reference (the stream can be saved
into a file for later inspection with dBase).

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 direction

=over 4

=item * CONVERT_FROM

Converts FROM a DBF stream or file into a Perl array reference.

=item * CONVERT_TO

Converts TO a a DBF stream or file, from a Perl array reference.

=back

=head2 header_wanted

Saves the header of the structure into C<< $proc->header >>. You can
reach it via C<< $flow->procs->[ $i ]->header >>, where C<$i> is the
index of the DBF processor in your flow. For example:

  my $flow = DataFlow->new([
      [ 'DBF' => { direction => 'CONVERT_FROM', header_wanted => 1 } ],
  ]);

  my $perl_data = $flow->process( $dbf_data );
  my $header    = $flow->procs->[0]->header;

=head2 dbf_opts

  my $flow = DataFlow->new([
     [ 'DBF' => {
         direction => 'CONVERT_FROM',
         dbf_opts  => { name => 'dbase.dbf' },
       }
     ],
  ]);

Sets any particular option you may want to pass to L<XBase>. The most
important one being B<name>, in which you can specify a file name
for either input (CONVERT_FROM) or output (CONVERT_TO).


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item C<< Error creating DBF: $MESSAGE >>

The conversor was unable to create a DBF file with the provided structure.
Make sure you pass a matrix with lines containing the same number of elements.
